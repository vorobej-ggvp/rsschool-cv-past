  <p>I want to get into IT as a good specialist. I'm always eager to learn something new, so I'm a quick learner. Although I have no work experience, but I am ready for all the difficulties of any profession, because difficulties harden us.</p>
  
  <p>I study C++, have the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>
