            Hello, I've waited here for you
            Everlong
            Tonight, I throw myself into
            And out of the red
            Out of her head, she sang
            
            [Verse 2]
            Come down, and waste away with me
            Down with me
            Slow, how you wanted it to be
            I'm over my head
            Out of her head, she sang
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            And I wonder
            When I sing along with you
            
            [Chorus]
            If everything could ever feel this real forever
            If anything could ever be this good again
            The only thing I'll ever ask of you
            You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
            She sang
            
            [Verse 3]
            Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
            Hold you in
            And now I know you've always been
            Out of your head, out of my head I sang
            [Pre-Chorus]
            And I wonder
            When I sing along with you
            
            [Chorus]
            If everything could ever feel this real forever
            If anything could ever be this good again
            The only thing I'll ever ask of you
            You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
            She sang
            
            [Instrumental Break with whispering voices]
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            And I wonder
            
            [Chorus]
            If everything could ever feel this real forever
            If anything could ever be this good again
            The only thing I'll ever ask of you
            You've got to promise not to stop when I say when</span>
